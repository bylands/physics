    "## Euler Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the Euler method is to calculate the slope at the starting point using the differential equation. Taking a small step in the direction of the tangent line provides a good approximation for a next point on the (unknown) curve. The process is then repeated, leading to a series of points that approximate the real function. The error can be decreased by decreasing the step size.\n",

    "- Find the slope at the starting point $x_0=x(t_0)$: $\\dot{x}(t_0)=f(t_0, x_0)\n",
    "- Assuming the slope does not change over the time interval $\\Delta t$, the step to the next point is as follows: <br/> $\\dfrac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}\\approx \\dot{x}(t_0) \\Longrightarrow \\Delta x \\approx \\dot{x}(t_0)\\cdot \\Delta t = f(t_0, x_0)\\cdot \\Delta t$\n",
    "- The next point is therefore $x_1 \\approx x_0+\\Delta x =x_0+f(t_0, x_0)\\cdot \\Delta t$\n",

    "The following code uses the Euler method to approximate the solution for the interval (0, 5). The number of steps ($N$) can be adjusted. The graph displays the numerical solution (red points) and the exact solution (dashed blue line). It is obvious that for a small number of points (i.e. a large time interval) the numerical calculation is only a poor approximation to the exact solution. Increasing the number of points leads to a much better agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem in a case where the exact solution is not known is to find out what a sufficient number of points is. Increasing the number to extreme values does not just increase the calculation time, but it can also cause problems because of the limited precision of the computer-based calucations."
